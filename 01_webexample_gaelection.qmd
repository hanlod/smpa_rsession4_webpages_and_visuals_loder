## Combine gender categories into total by race

```{r}
#create all_gender columns for black and white to combine gender-based ones provided in source
votedemos_2020_gen <- votedemos_2020_gen %>% 
  mutate(
    black_ALL_registered = black_male_registered + black_female_registered + black_unknown_registered,
    black_ALL_voted = black_male_voted + black_female_voted + black_unknown_voted,
    black_ALL_pct = round_half_up(black_ALL_voted / black_ALL_registered * 100, 2),
    white_ALL_registered = white_male_registered + white_female_registered + white_unknown_registered,
    white_ALL_voted = white_male_voted + white_female_voted + white_unknown_voted,
    white_ALL_pct = round_half_up(white_ALL_voted / white_ALL_registered * 100, 2)
  )

votedemos_2020_gen

```
Let's use select() to simplify our table

```{r}

votedemos_2020_gen <- votedemos_2020_gen %>% 
  select(
    elexyear, 
    elextype,
    county, 
    county_code,
    black_ALL_pct,
    black_male_pct,
    black_female_pct,
    white_ALL_pct,
    white_male_pct,
    white_female_pct
    )

votedemos_2020_gen

```



## Charts

Let's make some charts

```{r}
votedemos_2020_gen %>% 
  head(15) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(county, black_ALL_pct), y = black_ALL_pct)) + 
  geom_col(color = "black", fill = "blue") +
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Pct of Black Registered Voters Who Voted") +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "County") +
  theme_hc() +
  labs(title = "Voter Turnout in GA", 
       subtitle = "2020 General Election",
       caption = "Source: GA Sec State") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 45))


```

Fix the axis labels?


```{r}
votedemos_2020_gen %>% 
  head(15) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(county, white_ALL_pct), y = white_ALL_pct)) + 
  geom_col(color = "black", fill = "blue") +
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Pct of White Registered Voters Who Voted") +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "County") +
  theme_hc() +
  labs(title = "Voter Turnout in GA", 
       subtitle = "2020 General Election",
       caption = "Source: GA Sec State") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 45)) 
```
